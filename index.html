      <h1>NYC MetroCard Machines</h1>
      <p>Designing personas and a storyboard for users of the NYC Metro!</p>
    </div>

    
    <h2>Preparation:</h2>
    <div id="contents">
        <p>
            During a trip to New York City, I found myself particularly intrigued by the design of the MetroCard machines.
            These archaic looking machines, are the heartbeat of a city of nearly 10 million people. I took it upon myself to
            observe the interactions and get a feel of the people and stories that surround those who commute through the metro.

         </p>

    <div class="sketch-container">
        <img class="sketch-item" src="./Sketch1.jpeg" alt="sketch of machine">
        <img class="sketch-item" src="./Sketch2.jpeg" alt="sketch of screen">
      </div>
    <div id="caption">
        <p>
            The sketches above depict the interfaces that those using the New York City Metro
            Machine must interact with in order to purchase a ticket for their travel. On the left
            is a sketch of the machine as a whole where users pay and receive their ticket, and on 
            the right is the screen in which users interact with to select the type of tickets they want.
            With a city as big as New York, a major problem this interface is working to solve is the efficiency
            of buying a ticket. About 4.3 million people use the metro daily so the system for ticketing needs to be 
            simple, quick, and efficient. Its key components consist of a touch screen interface with options
            to either purchase or reload a card, a fast trip, or a single destination trip. This makes it simple to follow
            and leaves little to question. The components on the actual machine, such as the card reader, cashbox, and ticket dispenser, 
            are strategically placed as well to allow for better usability. Once the selection is made and paid for, the machine processes it
            and dispenses the ticket to the user through the dispenser at the bottom, and that is the end of the interaction
            for a user.

    <h3>Recording Observations:</h3>
    <div id="keyObs">
        <header>I made  observations of the users of the interface to gauge their interactions with it. I gained insight
            on the struggles and motivations when using the machine. Here are some of the key observations I made! </header>

    <div class="observationCont">
        <li>One user was very quick at the process and went through the machine as if they 
            had done it a hundred times. It looked very routine.
        </li>
        <li>Another user had a lots of luggage with them and pressed on the screen very slowly, taking
            the time to read each option. 
        </li>
        <li>Other users spent a lot of time at the machine as they would keep pressing the wrong option and haver to 
            start over.
        </li>
    </div>
    <div id="introInt">
    <header>I also interviewed a few of the users as well to learn about their experiences with 
        the interface as well as any challenges that they encounter. Below you can find the questions
    I asked and an overview of the feedback I got! </header>
</div>

   <div class="interviewCont">
       <header>Questions:</header>
        <ol>
            <li>What would you improve about the MetroCard Machine interface?</li>
            <li>Do you always use the MetroCard Machine or just occasionally?</li>
            <li>Why use the machine when you can purchase tickets on your phone?</li>



        </ol>
        <header>Responses:</header>
        <ul>
            <li>The interface can be challenging if you are new to it due to not knowing 
                how the New York Metro works and what the right ticket to buy is.
            </li>
            <li>The phone is more convenient but using the old system feels more satisfying.</li>
            <li>Use of the MetroCard machine is limited to being in the city as outside of the city, it is easier to use a car.</li>
            <li>It can get tiring using the machine whenever you forget to load your card or just need a single
                ticket.</li>


        </ul>
    </div> 
</div>

<h4>Personas:</h4>
    <div id="personaHeader">
        <header>Next, I constructed two unique personas based on what I gathered from my 
                observations and interviews.
        </header>
    </div>

    <div class="persona-container">
        <img class="persona-item" src="./persona1.jpeg" alt="James persona">
        <img class="persona-item" src="./sonja.jpeg" alt="Sonja persona">
    </div>
    <div class="description-container">
     <p class="description-item">
         James is an aspiring actor who lives in New York City and resided there for 
    quite some time. One of the interface issues that James encounters is that using the machine
    is an extra obstacle for him to do during the day. He sometimes finds it to be slow when he is usually 
    in a hurry to get places. This persona represents the users of the MetroCard interface because 
    locals of NYC are the largest group of users to ride the New York subway. It represents how using it 
    can be tiresome, but it is a routine for them.
    </p>
     <p class="description-item">
         Sonja is a tourist from India who is visiting New York City for the first time.
    Her issues with the interface involve the fact that she is unsure of what each option means 
    and which is right for her. She is also nervous that it is difficult to find someone to help her.
    Sonja represents the other side of the users of the interface. Those who are entirely unfamiliar with it, but
    since NYC is such a popular tourist destination, it is something that a user must learn to interact with.

<h5>Storyboard:</h5>
<div id="sbHeader">
    <header>
    Finally, I created a storyboard centered around one of my constructed personas.
    Below you will see a storyboard depicting Sonja's interaction with the MetroCard machine
    from start to finish.
    </header>
    <p>
        This storyboard was generated using Boords.

<div id="conclusion">
<p>
    This storyboard briefly shows a start to end interaction with the interface. It captures
    the hustle and bustle of a fast paced tranist system and a tourist trying to fit into that.
 </p>

 <p>
    I hope this site gave you some insight on the interface of the NYC MetroCard machine 
    interface!
